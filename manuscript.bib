  abstract =	 {Butyrophilin-like 2 (BTNL2) is a butyrophilin family member with homology to the B7 costimulatory
                  molecules, polymorphisms of which have been recently associated through genetic analyses to sporadic
                  inclusion body myositis and sarcoidosis. We have characterized the full structure, expression, and
                  function of BTNL2. Structural analysis of BTNL2 shows a molecule with an extracellular region
                  containing two sets of two Ig domains, a transmembrane region, and a previously unreported cytoplasmic
                  tail. Unlike most other butyrophilin members, BTNL2 lacks the prototypical B30.2 ring domain. TaqMan
                  and Northern blot analysis indicate BTNL2 is predominantly expressed in digestive tract tissues, in
                  particular small intestine and Peyer's patches. Immunohistochemistry with BTNL2-specific Abs further
                  localizes BTNL2 to epithelial and dendritic cells within these tissues. Despite its homology to the B7
                  family, BTNL2 does not bind any of the known B7 family receptors such as CD28, CTLA-4, PD-1, ICOS, or
                  B and T lymphocyte attenuator. Because of its localization in the gut and potential role in the immune
                  system, BTNL2 expression was analyzed in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. BTNL2 is
                  overexpressed during both the asymptomatic and symptomatic phase of the Mdr1a knockout model of
                  spontaneous colitis. In functional assays, soluble BTNL2-Fc protein inhibits the proliferation of
                  murine CD4+ T cells from the spleen, mesenteric lymph node, and Peyer's patch. In addition, BTNL2-Fc
                  reduces proliferation and cytokine production from T cells activated by anti-CD3 and B7-related
                  protein 1. These data suggest a role for BTNL2 as a negative costimulatory molecule with implications
                  for inflammatory disease.},

  abstract =	 {The usefulness of genomic prediction in crop and livestock breeding programs has prompted efforts to
                  develop new and improved genomic prediction algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and
                  gradient tree boosting. However, the performance of these algorithms has not been compared in a
                  systematic manner using a wide range of datasets and models. Using data of 18 traits across six plant
                  species with different marker densities and training population sizes, we compared the performance of
                  six linear and six non-linear algorithms. First, we found that hyperparameter selection was necessary
                  for all non-linear algorithms and that feature selection prior to model training was critical for
                  artificial neural networks when the markers greatly outnumbered the number of training lines. Across
                  all species and trait combinations, no one algorithm performed best, however predictions based on a
                  combination of results from multiple algorithms (i.e., ensemble predictions) performed consistently
                  well. While linear and non-linear algorithms performed best for a similar number of traits, the
                  performance of non-linear algorithms vary more between traits. Although artificial neural networks did
                  not perform best for any trait, we identified strategies (i.e., feature selection, seeded starting
                  weights) that boosted their performance to near the level of other algorithms. Our results highlight
                  the importance of algorithm selection for the prediction of trait values.},

  abstract =	 {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach
                  to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using
                  the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has
                  examined {$\sim$}2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of {$\sim$}3,000
                  controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at
                  P\,{$<$}\,5\,\texttimes\,10-7: 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's
                  disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of
                  prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine
                  susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found
                  compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all
                  diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P
                  values between 10-5 and 5\,\texttimes\,10-7) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The
                  importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most
                  loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also
                  demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to
                  GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future
                  studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with
                  non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population
                  is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these
                  important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available
                  to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.},

                  address important questions, genomic datasets of a meaningful size have not generally been available
                  in livestock species. We describe a pig dataset that PIC (a Genus company) has made available for
                  comparing genomic prediction methods. We also describe genomic evaluation of the data using methods
                  that PIC considers best practice for predicting and validating genomic breeding values, and we discuss
                  the impact of data structure on accuracy. The dataset contains 3534 individuals with high-density
                  genotypes, phenotypes, and estimated breeding values for five traits. Genomic breeding values were
                  calculated using BayesB, with phenotypes and de-regressed breeding values, and using a single-step
                  genomic BLUP approach that combines information from genotyped and un-genotyped animals. The genomic
                  breeding value accuracy increased with increased trait heritability and with increased relationship
                  between training and validation. In nearly all cases, BayesB using de-regressed breeding values

                  overestimation of genomic breeding value accuracies, with implications for genotyping strategies to

                  interaction effects coupled with single-gene effects are active. Many interaction models have been

  abstract =	 {There are 512 two-locus, two-allele, two-phenotype, fully penetrant disease models. Using the
                  permutation between two alleles, between two loci, and between being affected and unaffected, one
                  model can be considered to be equivalent to another model under the corresponding permutation. These
                  permutations greatly reduce the number of two-locus models in the analysis of complex diseases. This
                  paper determines the number of nonredundant two-locus models (which can be 102, 100, 96, 51, 50, or
                  58, depending on which permutations are used, and depending on whether zero-locus and single-locus
                  models are excluded). Whenever possible, these nonredundant two-locus models are classified by their
                  property. Besides the familiar features of multiplicative models (logical AND), heterogeneity models
                  (logical OR), and threshold models, new classifications are added or expanded: modifying-effect
                  models, logical XOR models, interference and negative interference models (neither dominant nor
                  recessive), conditionally dominant/recessive models, missing lethal genotype models, and highly
                  symmetric models. The following aspects of two-locus models are studied: the marginal penetrance
                  tables at both loci, the expected joint identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities, and the correlation
                  between marginal IBD probabilities at the two loci. These studies are useful for linkage analyses
                  using single-locus models while the underlying disease model is two-locus, and for correlation
                  analyses using the linkage signals at different locations obtained by a single-locus model.},

                  susceptibility and identify SNPs that discriminate between RA patients who were anti-cyclic

                  North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium. A cohort of 908 RA cases and 1,260 controls was used
                  to discover pairwise interactions among SNPs and to identify a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms
                  (SNPs) that predict RA status, and a second cohort of 952 cases and 1,760 controls was used to
                  validate the findings. After adjusting for HLA-shared epitope alleles, we identified and replicated
                  seven SNP pairs within the HLA class II locus with significant interaction effects. We failed to
                  replicate significant pairwise interactions among non-HLA SNPs. The machine learning approach "random
                  forest" applied to a set of SNPs selected from single-SNP and pairwise interaction tests identified 93
                  SNPs that distinguish RA cases from controls with 70\% accuracy. HLA SNPs provide the most
                  classification information, and inclusion of non-HLA SNPs improved classification. While specific
                  gene-gene interactions are difficult to validate using genome-wide SNP data, a stepwise approach
                  combining association and classification methods identifies candidate interacting SNPs that

  abstract =	 {Interpreting predictions from tree ensemble methods such as gradient boosting machines and random
                  forests is important, yet feature attribution for trees is often heuristic and not individualized for
                  each prediction. Here we show that popular feature attribution methods are inconsistent, meaning they
                  can lower a feature's assigned importance when the true impact of that feature actually
                  increases. This is a fundamental problem that casts doubt on any comparison between features. To
                  address it we turn to recent applications of game theory and develop fast exact tree solutions for
                  SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values, which are the unique consistent and locally accurate
                  attribution values. We then extend SHAP values to interaction effects and define SHAP interaction
                  values. We propose a rich visualization of individualized feature attributions that improves over
                  classic attribution summaries and partial dependence plots, and a unique "supervised" clustering
                  (clustering based on feature attributions). We demonstrate better agreement with human intuition
                  through a user study, exponential improvements in run time, improved clustering performance, and
                  better identification of influential features. An implementation of our algorithm has also been merged

                  association studies for common complex diseases are now imminent. Although these conditions involve a
                  complex relationship between genotype and phenotype, including interactions between unlinked loci1,
                  the prevailing strategies for analysis of such studies focus on the locus-by-locus paradigm. Here we
                  consider analytical methods that explicitly look for statistical interactions between loci. We show
                  first that they are computationally feasible, even for studies of hundreds of thousands of loci, and
                  second that even with a conservative correction for multiple testing, they can be more powerful than
                  traditional analyses under a range of models for interlocus interactions. We also show that plausible
                  variations across populations in allele frequencies among interacting loci can markedly affect the
                  power to detect their marginal effects, which may account in part for the well-known difficulties in
                  replicating association results. These results suggest that searching for interactions among genetic

                  large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can

                  particular challenge, and has been the target of bioinformatic development. Thorough evaluation of new
                  algorithms calls for simulation studies in which known disease models are sought. To date, the best
                  methods for generating simulated multi-locus epistatic models rely on genetic algorithms. However,
                  such methods are computationally expensive, difficult to adapt to multiple objectives, and unlikely to
                  yield models with a precise form of epistasis which we refer to as pure and strict. Purely and
                  strictly epistatic models constitute the worst-case in terms of detecting disease associations, since
                  such associations may only be observed if all n-loci are included in the disease model. This makes
                  them an attractive gold standard for simulation studies considering complex multi-locus effects.},

                  mitochondrial alterations can result in pathology, like lipodystrophy or type 2 diabetes. Although
                  Pgc1{$\alpha$} is regarded as the main regulator of mitochondrial function, downstream Nrf1 is the key
                  regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Nrf1 is also involved in a wide range of other processes,
                  including proliferation, innate immune response, and apoptosis. To determine transcriptional targets
                  of Nrf1, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with either pNrf1 or a control vector. Two days
                  post-confluence, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were allowed to differentiate. At day 8 of differentiation, Nrf1
                  overexpressing cells had an increased mtDNA copy number and reduced lipid content. This was not

                  expression. In addition, prolonged Nrf1 induced an adipokine expression profile of insulin resistant
                  adipocytes. Nrf1 has a wide range of transcriptional targets, stimulators as well as inhibitors of
                  adipose tissue functioning. Therefore, post-transcriptional regulation of Nrf1, or stimulating
                  specific Nrf1 targets may be a more suitable approach for stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and
                  treating adipose tissue defects, instead of directly stimulating Nrf1 expression. In addition, our

                  neurological abnormalities. The molecular mechanism of the NGLY1 disease and its function in tissue
                  and immune homeostasis remain unknown. Here, we find that NGLY1-deficient human and mouse cells

                  well as MDA5-MAVS pathways. Furthermore, we show that NGLY1 regulates mitochondrial homeostasis

This small segment of the human genome has been associated with more than 100 different diseases, including common diseases, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, asthma and various other autoimmune disorders. The first complete and continuous HLA 3.6\,Mb genomic sequence was reported in 1999 with the annotation of 224 gene loci, including coding and non-coding genes that were reviewed extensively in 2004. In this review, we present (1) an updated list of all the HLA gene symbols, gene names, expression status, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) numbers, including new genes, and latest changes to gene names and symbols, (2) a regional analysis of the extended class I, class I, class III, class II and extended class II subregions, (3) a summary of the interspersed repeats (retrotransposons and transposons), (4) examples of the sequence diversity between different HLA haplotypes, (5) intra- and extra-HLA gene interactions and (6) some of the HLA gene expression profiles and HLA genes associated with autoimmune and infectious diseases. Overall, the degrees and types of HLA super-locus coordinated gene expression profiles and gene variations have yet to be fully elucidated, integrated and defined for the processes involved with normal cellular and tissue physiology, inflammatory and immune responses, and autoimmune and infectious diseases.},

  abstract = {Elucidating the mechanisms that sustain asthmatic inflammation is critical for precision therapies. We found that IL-6 and STAT3 transcription factor-dependent upregulation of Notch4 receptor on Iung tissue regulatory T (Treg) cells is necessary for allergens and particulate matter pollutants to promote airway inflammation. Notch4 subverted Treg cells into TH2 and TH17 effector T (Teff) cells by Wnt and Hippo pathway-dependent mechanisms. Wnt activation induced growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) expression in Treg cells, which activated group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) to provide a feed-forward mechanism for aggravated inflammation. Notch4, Wnt and Hippo were upregulated on circulating Treg cells of asthmatics as a function of disease severity, in association with reduced Treg cell-mediated suppression. Our studies thus identify Notch4-mediated immune tolerance subversion as a fundamental mechanism that licenses tissue inflammation in asthma.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, remains a global threat to human health, but knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of tuberculosis is still limited. Although Notch4, a member of the Notch receptor family, is involved in the initiation of mammary tumors, its function in M. tuberculosis infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that Notch4-deficient mice were more resistant to M. tuberculosis infection, with a much lower bacterial burden and fewer pathological changes in the lungs. Notch4 inhibited M. tuberculosis-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines by interaction with TAK1 and inhibition of its activation. Furthermore, we found that Notch intracellular domain 4 prevented TRAF6 autoubiquitination and suppressed TRAF6-mediated TAK1 polyubiquitination. Finally, Notch inhibitors made mice more resistant to M. tuberculosis infection. These results suggest that Notch4 is a negative regulator of M. tuberculosis-induced inflammatory response, and treatment with a Notch inhibitor could serve as a new therapeutic strategy for tuberculosis.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive expression analysis of human and murine BTN and BTNL genes in conditions associated with intestinal inflammation and cancer. Using real-time PCR, expression of human BTN and BTNL genes was analyzed in samples from patients with ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and colon tumors. Expression of murine Btn and Btnl genes was examined in mouse models of spontaneous colitis (Muc2-/-) and intestinal tumorigenesis (ApcMin/+). Our analysis indicates a strong association of several of the human genes with ulcerative colitis and colon cancer; while especially BTN1A1, BTN2A2, BTN3A3, and BTNL8 were significantly altered in inflammation, colonic tumors exhibited significantly decreased levels of BTNL2, BTNL3, BTNL8, and BTNL9 as compared to unaffected tissue. Colonic inflammation in Muc2-/- mice significantly down-regulated the expression of particularly Btnl1, Btnl4, and Btnl6 mRNA, and intestinal polyps derived from ApcMin/+ mice displayed altered levels of Btn1a1, Btn2a2, and Btnl1 transcripts. Thus, our data present an association of BTN and BTNL genes with intestinal inflammation and cancer and represent a valuable resource for further studies of this gene family.},

  abstract = {Random forests (RFs) are a widely used modelling tool capable of feature selection via a variable importance measure (VIM), however, a threshold is needed to control for false positives. In the absence of a good understanding of the characteristics of VIMs, many current approaches attempt to select features associated to the response by training multiple RFs to generate statistical power via a permutation null, by employing recursive feature elimination, or through a combination of both. However, for high-dimensional datasets these approaches become computationally infeasible. In this paper, we present RFlocalfdr, a statistical approach, built on the empirical Bayes argument of Efron, for thresholding mean decrease in impurity (MDI) importances. It identifies features significantly associated with the response while controlling the false positive rate. Using synthetic data and real-world data in health, we demonstrate that RFlocalfdr has equivalent accuracy to currently published approaches, while being orders of magnitude faster. We show that RFlocalfdr can successfully threshold a dataset of 10^6 datapoints, establishing its usability for large-scale datasets, like genomics. Furthermore, RFlocalfdr is compatible with any RF implementation that returns a VIM and counts, making it a versatile feature selection tool that reduces false discoveries.},

Microarray examples are used to illustrate the method.

This paper uses local false discovery rate methods to carry out size and power calculations on large-scale data sets. An empirical Bayes approach allows the fdr analysis to proceed from a minimum of frequentist or Bayesian modeling assumptions. Microarray and simulated data sets are used to illustrate a convenient estimation methodology whose accuracy can be calculated in closed form.

  abstract = {The classic frequentist theory of hypothesis testing developed by Neyman, Pearson and Fisher has a claim to being the twentieth century's most influential piece of applied mathematics. Something new is happening in the twenty-first century: high-throughput devices, such as microarrays, routinely require simultaneous hypothesis tests for thousands of individual cases, not at all what the classical theory had in mind. In these situations empirical Bayes information begins to force itself upon frequentists and Bayesians alike. The two-groups model is a simple Bayesian construction that facilitates empirical Bayes analysis. This article concerns the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas in the two-groups setting, with particular attention focused on Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate method. Topics include the choice and meaning of the null hypothesis in large-scale testing situations, power considerations, the limitations of permutation methods, significance testing for groups of cases (such as pathways in microarray studies), correlation effects, multiple confidence intervals and Bayesian competitors to the two-groups model.},

  abstract = {In cancer research at the molecular level, it is critical to understand which somatic mutations play an important role in the initiation or progression of cancer. Recently, studying cancer somatic variants at the protein domain level is an important area for uncovering functionally related somatic mutations. The main issue is to find the protein domain hotspots which have significantly high frequency of mutations. Multiple testing procedures are commonly used to identify hotspots; however, when data is not large enough, existing methods produce unreliable results with failure in controlling a given type I error rate. We propose multiple testing procedures, based on Bayesian local false discovery rate, for sparse count data and apply it in the identification of clusters of somatic mutations across entire gene families using protein domain models. In multiple testing for count data, it is not clear what kind of the null distribution should be admitted. In our proposed algorithms, we implement the zero assumption in the context of Bayesian methods to identify the null distribution for count data rather than using any theoretical null distribution. Furthermore, we also address different types of modeling of alternative distributions. The proposed fully Bayesian models are efficient when the number of count data is small (50{$\leq$}N{$<$}200) while the local false discovery rate procedures, based on the empirical Bayes, is desirable for a large number of data (N{$>$}800). We provide numerical studies to show that the proposed fully Bayesian methods can control a given level of false discovery rate for small number of positions while existing approaches based on nonparametric empirical Bayes fail in controlling a false discovery rate. In addition, we present real data examples of protein domain data to select hotspots in protein domain data.},
